      { speaker: "Anya", en: "Sure. Before I dive in, just a heads-up — the numbers I'm about to share are still provisional." },
      { speaker: "Anya", en: "The headline is that we're tracking slightly behind on adoption, but ahead on revenue." },
      { speaker: "Marco", en: "Sorry to jump in — could you clarify what you mean by ‘behind on adoption’? Behind forecast, or behind last quarter?" },
      { speaker: "Anya", en: "Good question. Behind forecast — last quarter we're actually up." },
      { speaker: "You", en: "Can I just build on Anya's point for a second? If we're up year-on-year but behind forecast, the issue might be with how we're forecasting, not with the product itself." },
      { speaker: "Marco", en: "I take your point, but I'd push back slightly — our forecasts have been pretty solid all year." },
      { speaker: "You", en: "Fair enough. I'm not saying we throw them out, just that we revisit the assumptions." },
      { speaker: "Chair", en: "Good — let's park that for now and pick it up in a separate session. Anything else on the roadmap?" },
      { speaker: "Anya", en: "One more thing, if I may — we'll need a decision on the pricing tier by end of next week, otherwise it'll slip into Q4." },

        title: "Floor-taking without rudeness",
        body: "‘Sorry to jump in, but…’, ‘Can I just come in here?’, ‘If I could add something quickly…’, ‘Just to build on that…’ — all let you interrupt without sounding like you're interrupting. The apology (‘sorry to…’) is performative — nobody actually thinks you're sorry — but it's the price of admission.",

        title: "Diplomatic disagreement: agree-then-pivot",
        body: "‘I take your point, but…’, ‘I see where you're coming from, however…’, ‘That's a fair point — I'd just add…’, ‘I'd push back slightly on that.’ Always acknowledge first, then pivot. Bare ‘I disagree’ is fine in informal teams but reads as combative in most professional rooms.",

      {
        title: "Meeting verbs you'll only meet in meetings",
        body: "to kick off = to start; to dive in = to begin in detail; to park (something) = to set aside for later; to loop (someone) in = to include in a thread/discussion; to circle back = to return to a topic; to action (something) = to assign as a task (verb, jargon); to land on = to reach (a decision); to wrap up = to conclude.",

        title: "Hedging proposals with conditionals and softeners",
        body: "‘What if we tried…?’, ‘Could we maybe…?’, ‘One option might be to…’, ‘I wonder whether it'd be worth…’. Putting the proposal in question form invites engagement instead of forcing a yes/no. ‘Just an idea, but…’ is the universal disclaimer that lets you float something risky.",

        title: "Bringing others in — the chair's toolkit",
        body: "‘What are your thoughts, Sarah?’, ‘Anything to add from your side, Marco?’, ‘Let's hear from the team on the ground.’ Senior English speakers actively pull quieter voices in — it's a status move, not a kindness.
